# Multiple-Choice Quiz

## Description
I created this repository to hold my submission for the week6 challenge which was to create a Multiple-Choice Quiz which presents a series of multiple choice questions and then displays your score on a leaderboard at the end

This task helped me understand basic front end javascript methods such as innerHTML, textcontent, localStorage and how to set and get data from it, query selectors and basic DOM manipulation

Below is a gif of what the project should look like when opened in the browser
